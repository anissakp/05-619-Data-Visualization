			<h2>Fatal Accidental Overdoses in Allegheny County</h2>
			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How has the composition of fatal overdoses changed over time, and what does this reveal about
					evolving drug markets?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Motivation: Drug markets shift rapidly. The opioid crisis moved from prescription pills (early
						2000s) to heroin (2010s) to synthetic fentanyl (recent years).
						This 2007-2025 dataset captures nearly two decades of change. Tracking which substances kill
						people over time helps predict future threats and target interventions effectively.</li>
					<li>Source: https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/opioids</li>
				</ul>
				<li>How common are multi-drug overdoses, and which drug combinations are most lethal?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Motivation: Media coverage focuses on single drugs like fentanyl, but this dataset records up to
						10 substances per death.
						Most fatal overdoses likely involve multiple drugs that interact dangerously. Identifying the
						deadliest combinations informs treatment protocols and harm reduction messaging, yet gets little
						public attention.</li>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

			<h3>Data Overview</h3>

			<p>This analysis examines 7,479 fatal overdose cases in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania from 2007-2025 -
				nearly two decades that span the entire modern overdose crisis.
				The timeline captures three distinct eras: the early prescription opioid wave, the heroin epidemic, and
				today's synthetic fentanyl crisis.
				Each case contains detailed records: up to 10 substances per death, demographic data, timing, and
				location. Together, these variables create a comprehensive picture of how overdose patterns have
				shifted, who they affect, and where they occur.</p>

				<figcaption>
					This missing data analysis highlights patterns with important implications for analytical capacity.
					Missing values increase systematically in the higher-order substance fields (combined_od5 - 10),
					though
					this reflects the rarity of complex polydrug cases rather than deficiencies in data quality. In
					contrast,
					demographic variables such as age, race, and gender demonstrate excellent completeness (< 0.2%
						missing), supporting robust analysis. The one major limitation is the complete absence of
						residential ZIP codes (decedent_zip), which prevents exploration of mobility patterns between
						residence and overdose location. </figcaption>
			</figure>

			<body>

				When first reviewing the dataset, I was especially interested in potential disparities between where
				individuals lived and
				where they died from overdoses, as these differences could shed light on access to resources and the
				organization of local drug
				markets. The dataset includes both residential ZIP codes (decedent_zip) and incident ZIP codes
				(incident_zip) - a distinction that
				could have revealed patterns related to treatment accessibility, socioeconomic conditions, and drug
				distribution geography.
				For example, if overdoses regularly occurred far from individualsâ€™ homes, this might indicate
				concentrated drug markets or
				neighborhood-level inequities. Unfortunately, the decedent_zip field is entirely empty, eliminating the
				possibility of pursuing
				this line of analysis.


				<p>In addition to missing value analysis, I performed outlier detection using both statistical methods
					(interquartile range and
					z-score analysis) and domain knowledge checks. This process flagged three cases with reported ages
					over 95, twelve ZIP codes
					with unusually high case counts, and eight cases involving more than seven substances
					simultaneously. Upon closer inspection,
					these records proved to be legitimate rather than data quality issues, though they highlight the
					extreme variability in overdose
					circumstances.</p>

			</body>
			<figure>
				<div id="temporal-quality-chart"></div>
				<figcaption>
					This temporal data quality assessment indicates consistent and reliable collection practices across
					the study period (2007â€“2025).
					Annual case counts, shown alongside a trend line, capture the epidemiological trajectory of the
					crisis: steady growth from 2007â€“2013,
					a sharp surge during 2014â€“2017 with the emergence of fentanyl, and subsequent fluctuations linked to
					policy interventions and supply
					chain disruptions. Importantly, the absence of systematic gaps or artificial spikes suggests stable
					data collection practices,
					strengthening the credibility of temporal trend analyses. The slight decline in recent years likely
					reflects both the impact of
					interventions and potential reporting delays in the most recent data.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<div id="demographic-profile-chart"></div>
				<figcaption>
					This demographic profile analysis confirms that the dataset provides representative coverage across
					key demographic dimensions. Most overdose cases fall within the 25â€“55 age range. Gender distribution
					shows a clear male predominance, with about 70% of cases involving men. Racial distribution
					indicates a majority of White individuals, alongside substantial representation from Black and
					Hispanic communities.

			<h3>Question 1: Temporal Evolution of the Overdose Crisis</h3>

			<p><strong>How has the composition of fatal overdoses changed over time, and what does this reveal about
					evolving drug markets?</strong></p>

			<p>To explore how the composition of fatal overdoses has changed over time, I began by examining which
				substances appeared most frequently in the dataset. Using pandas in Python, I calculated the frequency
				of each drug recorded as the primary substance (combined_od1) and identified the top eight drugs:
				Fentanyl (2110), Cocaine (1679), Alcohol (1063), Heroin (550), Alprazolam (499), Acetyl Fentanyl (220),
				Clonazepam (111), and Methadone (89). Since these accounted for the vast majority of cases, I grouped
				all remaining substances into a single "Other" category. This step reduced noise from rarely occurring
				drugs and made the visualization more interpretable, ensuring the analysis highlights the key substances
				driving shifts in overdose trends.</p>

			<figure>
				<div id="vis"></div>
				<figcaption>
					This stacked area chart illustrates the transformation of Allegheny
					County's fatal overdose crisis from 2007-2025, where the thickness of each colored band represents
					the number of deaths caused by that substance. The visualization reveals three distinct phases: an
					initial period (2007-2013) where the thickest bands were alcohol (green), cocaine (orange), and
					heroin (brown), with relatively stable total deaths around 200 cases annually; a transition period
					(2014-2016) marked by explosive growth in total overdoses reaching nearly 800 cases, driven
					primarily by the emergence of thick bands of acetyl fentanyl (pink) and fentanyl (red); and a recent
					plateau phase (2017-2025) where fentanyl (red) has become the thickest single band, indicating it
					causes the most deaths and accounts for the largest portion of the 400-600 annual fatalities.
					Notably, heroin's band (brown) virtually disappears after 2018, demonstrating the complete market
					displacement by synthetic opioids. This pattern exemplifies the national transition from the second
					wave (heroin) to the third wave (synthetic fentanyl) of the opioid epidemic.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>The stacked area chart revealed the broad outlines of market transformation, but it raised several
				important questions requiring deeper investigation. While the visualization demonstrated fentanyl's
				ascendance and heroin's decline, the overlapping colored bands made it difficult to pinpoint exactly
				when and how dramatically this displacement occurred. Additionally, the annual aggregation obscured
				potential seasonal variations that might reveal environmental or social factors influencing overdose
				timing. Finally, the purely temporal view provided no insights into whether these changes occurred
				uniformly across all neighborhoods or concentrated in specific geographic areas.</p>

			<p>To address these limitations, I developed three follow-up analyses that examine different dimensions of
				the temporal transformation: a focused comparison isolating the fentanyl-heroin displacement, a seasonal
				analysis revealing monthly patterns in overdose timing, and a geographic analysis mapping spatial
				variations in overdose concentration.</p>

			<h4>Market Displacement Analysis</h4>

			<figure>
				<div id="vis-fentanyl-heroin-fixed"></div>
				<figcaption>
					This line chart illustrates the complete displacement of heroin by fentanyl in Allegheny Countyâ€™s
					fatal overdose cases from 2007â€“2025, with data validation filters applied to ensure accuracy. The
					transformation unfolds in three phases. From 2007â€“2014, heroin remained a consistent presence with
					15â€“60 annual deaths (peaking around 2012â€“2013), while fentanyl was virtually absent. In 2015â€“2016, a
					sharp transition occurred: fentanyl deaths rose from fewer than 10 to over 50 annually as heroin
					cases began to decline. From 2017 onward, fentanyl fully dominated the market, reaching peaks of
					140+ deaths in 2017 and 2024, while heroin fell below 20 cases annually by 2018. This pattern
					represents one of the most rapid and complete market shifts in modern public health, as synthetic
					opioids displaced heroin within just three years - marking the transition from the epidemicâ€™s second
					wave (heroin) to its third wave (fentanyl).
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h4>Seasonal Patterns in Overdose Deaths</h4>

			<figure>
				<div id="vis-seasonal"></div>
				<figcaption>
					This bar chart shows relatively modest seasonal variation in Allegheny Countyâ€™s fatal overdoses
					between 2007 and 2025. March recorded the highest total at roughly 680 cases, followed by February
					with about 650. Most other months fall within a narrow band of 590â€“620 deaths over the 18-year
					period. The slight elevation in late winter and early spring (Februaryâ€“March) is noticeable but not
					dramatic, with the gap between the highest and lowest months spanning only about 80â€“100 cases.
					Overall, overdose deaths appear fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, though the small
					seasonal uptick may relate to factors such as holiday stress or winter supply chain disruptions.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h4>Geographic Concentration of the Crisis</h4>

			<figure>
				<div id="vis-geographic"></div>
				<figcaption>
					This horizontal bar chart highlights sharp geographic disparities in Allegheny Countyâ€™s overdose
					crisis. Zip code 15210 bears the heaviest burden, with approximately 380â€“400 fatal overdoses between
					2007 and 2025. It is followed by 15212 with 280â€“300 cases, while 15136 and 15132 each show about
					220â€“240. Several other zip codes - including 15216, 15235, 15221, and 15227 - cluster in the 180â€“200
					range. The remaining zip codes decline progressively, from roughly 160 down to about 110 cases. This
					concentration reveals that, although overdose deaths occur county-wide, certain neighborhoods face a
					disproportionately high toll. The pattern likely reflects a combination of factors, including
					proximity to drug markets, socioeconomic disadvantage, population density, and long-term
					disinvestment that heighten community vulnerability.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>

				The temporal analysis of fatal overdoses in Allegheny County reflects both the broader national opioid epidemic and distinct local patterns. The data shows three clear phases: a relatively stable mixed-substance crisis dominated by alcohol, cocaine, and heroin (2007â€“2013); a sharp transition driven by synthetic opioids (2014â€“2016); and a fentanyl-dominated plateau at historically high levels (2017â€“2025). Heroinâ€™s near-total replacement by fentanyl within three years marks one of the fastest and most complete drug market shifts documented in public health, underscoring fentanylâ€™s efficiency and lethality. Seasonal trends are modest, suggesting structural market forces outweigh environmental factors. However, the strong geographic clustering of deaths highlights disproportionate harm in certain neighborhoods, pointing to the need for interventions that address both the dangers of fentanyl and the socioeconomic vulnerabilities that amplify risk.
			</p>

			<h3>Question 2: The Hidden Complexity of Polydrug Overdoses</h3>

			<p><strong>How common are multi-drug overdoses, and which drug combinations are most lethal?</strong></p>

			<p>Public health discourse often frames the overdose crisis around single substances - "the fentanyl crisis"
				or "the heroin epidemic" - but this dataset's inclusion of up to 10 substances per case suggests a more
				complex reality. To investigate the true scope of polydrug involvement, I systematically analyzed
				substance co-occurrence patterns, examining both the frequency of multi-drug cases and identifying the
				most dangerous combinations. This analysis challenges single-substance narratives and reveals the
				complex toxicological interactions that characterize modern fatal overdoses.</p>

			<h4>The Prevalence of Multi-Drug Use</h4>

			<figure>
				<div id="vis-substance-count"></div>
				<figcaption>
					This bar chart challenges the notion of a single-substance overdose crisis by showing that
					multi-drug involvement is overwhelmingly the norm in Allegheny County from 2007â€“2025. Only about 19%
					of fatal overdoses involved a single substance, while 81% reflected combinations of two or more. The
					largest share came from two-substance overdoses (26%), closely followed by three-substance cases
					(25%), with four or more substances present in roughly 15% of deaths. This pattern demonstrates that
					fatal overdoses are rarely attributable to one drug alone; instead, they typically arise from
					complex interactions among depressants, stimulants, and prescription medications. These findings
					highlight the need for harm reduction and treatment strategies that address polydrug use
					holistically, rather than focusing narrowly on a single substance like fentanyl.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h4>Identifying the Most Lethal Combinations</h4>

			<figure>
				<div id="vis-drug-combinations"></div>
				<figcaption>
					This horizontal bar chart identifies the specific two-drug combinations driving Allegheny County's
					overdose mortality.
					Cocaine + Fentanyl is the most lethal two-drug
					combination, accounting for over 1,000 fatal cases in Allegheny County from 2007-2025. Fentanyl +
					Heroin ranks second with approximately 500-600 cases, while Alcohol + Cocaine comes third with
					around 350-400 cases. The chart shows several other combinations involving fentanyl variants (Acetyl
					Fentanyl + Fentanyl, Fentanyl + Para-Fluorofentanyl) and traditional pairings (Cocaine + Heroin,
					Alcohol + Fentanyl) with progressively lower case counts ranging from roughly 300 down to under 100
					cases.
					The dominance of fentanyl-based combinations throughout this
					ranking reflects both the prevalence of synthetic opioids in the local drug supply and fentanyl's
					particularly lethal nature when mixed with other depressants or when combined
					with stimulants that mask warning signs.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<body>
				<p>
					After analyzing the distribution of substances in fatal overdoses and identifying the most common
					two-drug combinations, I was curious to know what underlying patterns drive polydrug
					involvement? The initial findings showed that 81% of overdoses involve multiple substances, with
					cocaine + fentanyl standing out as the deadliest pairing, linked to more than 1,000 deaths.

				</p>
				<p>
					The dominance of multi-drug cases suggested that substances may follow distinct co-occurrence
					patterns - some appearing mostly in isolation, others almost always alongside additional drugs.
					Recognizing these differences could clarify whether certain substances, like fentanyl, routinely
					contaminate drug supplies or are deliberately combined, while prescription medications may more
					often cause overdoses on their own.

				</p>
				<p>
					This led to a follow-up question: which substances most commonly appear together, and which
					occur in isolation? Answering this could reveal mechanisms behind overdose risk (whether
					contamination, intentional mixing, or single-drug use) and guide more targeted prevention
					strategies.

				</p>
			</body>


			<h4>Identifying Substance Co-ocurrence Patterns</h4>
			<figure>
				<div id="vis-polydrug-interaction"></div>
				<figcaption>
					This stacked bar chart highlights distinct patterns in how substances appear in fatal overdoses,
					distinguishing between isolated use (a single substance) and co-occurring use (multiple substances
					present). Fentanyl, cocaine, and alcohol show the highest co-occurrence rates - approximately 85%,
					80%, and 90%, respectively - indicating that they rarely appear alone and are frequently combined
					with
					or contaminated by other drugs. Heroin falls in the middle, with about 70% of cases involving co-use
					and 30% occurring in isolation. In contrast, alprazolam and acetyl fentanyl display largely isolated
					patterns, with alprazolam appearing alone in about 95% of cases and acetyl fentanyl in roughly 98%.

					These findings challenge single-substance prevention models by revealing that the most lethal
					substances - fentanyl, cocaine, and alcohol - are overwhelmingly encountered in complex polydrug
					scenarios. </figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				The analysis of polydrug involvement in Allegheny Countyâ€™s fatal overdoses challenges the prevailing
				single-substance narrative and reveals a more complex toxicological reality. With 81% of cases
				involving multiple substances, polydrug use is not an outlier but the norm - making interactions between
				drugs, rather than any one substance, the primary driver of mortality. The prominence of the
				cocaineâ€“fentanyl pairing, linked to more than 1,000 deaths, illustrates how stimulantâ€“depressant
				combinations are uniquely dangerous: stimulants can obscure opioid overdose warning signs, while
				fentanyl contamination often occurs without usersâ€™ awareness. Co-occurrence patterns reinforce this
				dynamic. Fentanyl, cocaine, and alcohol appear with other drugs in 80â€“90% of cases, pointing to
				widespread contamination and intentional mixing practices, whereas prescription medications like
				alprazolam more often underlie single-substance deaths.

			</p>

			<h3>Question 3: Demographic Disparities and Structural Inequities</h3>

			<p><strong>How do demographic factors (age, race, gender) intersect with substance use patterns and overdose
					risk?</strong></p>

			<p>Understanding how age, race, and gender shape substance use patterns is crucial for designing equitable interventions and addressing the structural factors that drive overdose risk. This analysis explores whether certain demographic groups are disproportionately exposed to specific substances, experience distinct trajectories through the crisis, or are concentrated in particular geographic areas.</p>

			<h4>Age-Based Substance Pathways</h4>

			<figure>
				<div id="vis-age-substance-patterns"></div>
				<figcaption>
					This chart reveals that alcohol is the dominant substance across all age groups, with younger adults
					(18-34) showing the highest overall substance use patterns. The bars extending beyond 200% indicate
					significant polysubstance use, where individuals use multiple substances simultaneously. Cocaine use
					is most prevalent among younger age groups and decreases with age, while fentanyl maintains a
					concerning presence across all demographics. The 45-54 age group shows the lowest total substance
					involvement, but even the oldest group (55+) demonstrates substantial usage rates around 220%,
					highlighting that substance use disorders persist throughout the lifespan and often involve multiple
					substances concurrently.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h4>Racial Disparities in Crisis Timing</h4>

			<figure>
				<div id="vis-racial-disparities"></div>
				<figcaption>
					This chart shows racial disparities in overdose deaths over time, with White individuals
					experiencing higher death rates that peaked around 2017 at over 600 annual deaths
					before declining by 2025 to approximately 100 deaths. Black overdose deaths followed a
					different trajectory, remaining relatively low and stable from 2007-2015, then steadily increasing
					from around 50 deaths to peak at about 200 deaths in 2023 before declining. Hispanic overdose deaths
					remained consistently low throughout the entire time period, never exceeding roughly 25 annual
					deaths. The data reveals significant racial health disparities and suggests different
					phases of the overdose crisis may have disproportionately affected different communities. The
					White population experienced an earlier and more severe crisis that has since subsided, while Black
					communities saw increases during the latter part of the timeframe.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h4>Gender Differences in Polydrug Complexity</h4>

			<figure>
				<div id="vis-gender-polydrug"></div>
				<figcaption>
					The polydrug analysis shows that single-substance overdoses account for the vast majority of fatal cases across both genders, with about 95% involving just one primary substance. Polydrug involvement declines sharply as complexity increasesâ€”dropping to 55â€“60% for two substances, 35â€“40% for three, and only 30â€“35% for four or more. Gender differences remain minimal across all levels, indicating that patterns of polydrug use in fatal overdoses are strikingly similar between males and females. These findings challenge assumptions that widespread polydrug abuse drives most overdose deaths, showing instead that while polysubstance use is present and dangerous, the majority of fatalities stem from a single substance.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>

				Demographic factors create distinct overdose trajectories that reveal structural inequities in how
				different groups encounter the crisis. White individuals experienced peak mortality around 2017 (600+
				deaths annually) before declining, while Black individuals saw steady increases from 2015-2023 (reaching
				200 deaths annually), suggesting different pathways into the same epidemic. Age patterns show
				substantial polydrug involvement across all adult age groups, including those over 55, indicating that
				overdose risk persists throughout the lifespan rather than concentrating in young populations. Gender
				differences in polydrug complexity are minimal, but this apparent equality may mask different social
				pathways to equivalent outcomes. These disparities reveal that structural factors shape when and how different groups encounter dangerous
				substances, rather than individual behavioral differences driving overdose risk.

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>

				This analysis of 7,479 fatal overdose cases in Allegheny County (2007-2025) reveals three key findings.
				First, drug markets undergo rapid transformation - fentanyl completely displaced heroin within three
				years (2015-2018), driving deaths from 200 to 800 annually before stabilizing around 400-600. Second,
				polydrug overdoses dominate at 81% of cases, with cocaine + fentanyl being the deadliest combination
				(1,000+ deaths). Third, demographic groups experience different crisis trajectories - White deaths
				peaked in 2017 then declined, while Black deaths rose steadily through 2023, indicating structural
				inequities in how communities encounter dangerous substances. The crisis is characterized by synthetic
				drug innovation, supply chain contamination, and differential vulnerability rather than gradual
				evolution or uniform impact.
